# Dapper-Lax
A simple HTML/CSS solution for an easy parallax effect.

## Requirements
A web browser! This plugin is really basic and only uses HTML and CSS to create the effect. The magic happens with the css position and background attributes. Take a look at the code for more details.

## Known Issues
* iOS browsers tend to break at rendering the background images properly. I suspect this may be due to the background-size: cover attribute and how iOS calculates the window size for the site. Potential fix? I'm sure a little javascript will do the trick...
